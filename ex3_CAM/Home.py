Welcome! This application helps you explore Class Activation Maps (CAMs) and analyze the impact of image augmentations.

**Use the sidebar to navigate between tools:**
- **Image CAM Visualizer**: Upload an image, select a model and CAM method to see the visualization.
- **Augmentation Analyzer**: Apply transformations to an image, generate 10 variants, and analyze their model scores.

st.info("""
**Quick Start:**
1. Go to **Image CAM Visualizer** to test CAMs on a single image.
2. Go to **Augmentation Analyzer** to study how transformations affect model perception and CAMs.
   - You'll be able to choose one of the pre-selected transformations (e.g., Brightness, ShearX).
   - 10 augmented versions of your image will be generated.
   - CAMs and model confidence scores for a target class will be displayed for each.
   - Results can be downloaded as a CSV file.

**Dependencies**: `streamlit`, `torch`, `torchvision`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `Pillow`, `imgaug`.
Make sure these are installed in your Python environment.
